# DicAPI

A Node.js/Express REST API implementation with web scraping.
Having a API saves your effort to do the same scraping task over and over. Plus some space. 
You just call the API and handle the response, which will be feasible and won't be changing.

##Big Plus

If the target (website being scraped) changes something, we can manage it on the backend without having to change our front-ends.
